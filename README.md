## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repo._
* _Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "VendorOrder"._
* _Run dotnet watch run in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher._
* _Open the browser to https://localhost:5001. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
